Dashboard application for the Kochcloud, a self-hosted cloud service.
The goal is to provide an overview of all available services to logged-in users as well as self-service configuration for the users not available in the hosted services.

Currently implements generation of app-specific email passwords.

Built using Streamlit to keep the coding effort as simple and lightweight as possible.
